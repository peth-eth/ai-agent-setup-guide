# AI Agent Setup Guide

## From zero to a working 24/7 AI agent in one session

---

# PART 1: READ THIS FIRST (5 minutes)

Read this section yourself before pasting anything into Claude Code. It'll save you hours of frustration.

## What you're actually setting up

An AI agent is not a chatbot. It's a persistent process that runs on your machine 24/7, communicates via Telegram or Discord, runs scheduled tasks while you sleep, remembers everything across sessions, and can control your computer — browser, files, apps, APIs.

The gap between the demo and daily use is real. People posting "my agent built a full app overnight" have spent weeks tuning. This guide gets you to a working, useful setup in one session — but expect a week of refinement before it feels like a teammate instead of a babysitting job.

## The 7 things that actually matter

**1. Don't run everything through your best model.**
This is the #1 mistake. Heartbeats, cron checks, and routine tasks don't need Opus or Sonnet. Set up tiered routing: cheap models for grunt work, expensive models for thinking. People cut costs from 20-40k tokens per request down to 1.5k just by routing smarter.

**2. Your agent needs rules. A lot of them.**
Out of the box, it will loop, repeat itself, forget context, and make weird decisions. You need guardrails — a SOUL.md (identity), an OPERATING_CONTRACT.md (rules), and skills (behavioral instructions). The agents that work well are the ones with heavily customized instruction sets. You are the conductor.

**3. "Work on this overnight" doesn't work the way you think.**
If you close the chat, the agent forgets. Sessions are stateful only while open. For background work, you need cron jobs with isolated session targets — these spin up independent agent sessions that run on a schedule and message you results.

**4. Start with ONE thing working end-to-end.**
Don't set up email + calendar + Telegram + web scraping + cron all at once. Every integration is a separate failure mode. Get one workflow working perfectly (like a morning briefing), then add the next.

**5. Save what works.**
Context gets lost over time as sessions compact. Fill in your workspace docs (USER.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md) and store important decisions somewhere persistent. The less your agent has to re-learn, the better it performs.

**6. The model matters more than you think.**
Chat quality ≠ agent quality. Models need to handle tool calls reliably. Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-5.2, and Kimi K2 handle tool calls well. Avoid models that produce malformed tool calls (test before committing). Cheap models are fine for simple tasks but unreliable as the primary brain.

**7. You're not bad at this. It's genuinely hard right now.**
These platforms are not finished products. If you're spending the first two weeks babysitting, burning tokens, and watching your agent loop — that's normal. This guide exists to compress those two weeks into one session.

## The mindset shift

Most people use AI agents like chatbots: ask a question, get an answer, done. That's 5% of what you're setting up.

**Don't ask your agent questions. Give it standing orders.**

- Instead of "What's trending?" → "Every morning at 7am, tell me what's trending. If something is blowing up, alert me immediately."
- Instead of "Summarize this article" → "Whenever I share a URL, automatically summarize it and file it in my research folder."
- Instead of "Help me write a tweet" → "Build a skill that drafts tweets in my voice. When I say 'draft tweets about X', give me 5 options."

**The rule of thumb:** Done it 3 times → make it a skill. Do it daily → make it a cron job. Do it weekly → make it a scheduled task. The only tasks left for you should be the ones that genuinely require your judgment.

## What you'll need before starting

- [ ] A computer that can stay on (your daily laptop works, dedicated machine is better)
- [ ] An API key from at least one LLM provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, Moonshot, etc.)
- [ ] A Telegram account (recommended) or Discord server
- [ ] ~1 hour for the core setup, ~2 hours to do it properly
- [ ] Terminal/command-line basics (the AI assistant will help, but you should be able to run commands)

**Ready?** Copy everything below the line and paste it into Claude Code (or your AI coding assistant of choice). It will walk you through the rest interactively.

# PART 2: PASTE INTO CLAUDE CODE (everything below this line)

## AI Agent Setup Wizard

**To the AI assistant reading this:** You are a setup wizard. Walk the user through each phase below, one task at a time. After each task, confirm completion before moving on. Adapt commands to their OS and chosen platform. Mark tasks done as you go.

Start by asking:
1. Which platform? (OpenClaw / Hermes / other)
2. What OS? (Mac / Linux / Windows)
3. Primary goal? (productivity, content creation, coding, research, business)
4. Budget preference? (minimal ~$5/mo, moderate ~$30/mo, power ~$100+/mo)
5. How comfortable with terminal? (beginner / intermediate / advanced)

Then work through each phase in order. Skip what doesn't apply. One task at a time — never dump a whole phase at once.

---

## Phase 1: Install & Connect

### TODO
- [ ] Install the agent platform
- [ ] Choose and configure an LLM provider (get API key)
- [ ] Set up a messaging channel (Telegram or Discord)
- [ ] Lock messaging to your user ID only (security — do this NOW, not later)
- [ ] Verify the agent is running and responds to messages

### LLM Provider Quick Pick

| Budget | Primary (Brain) | Fallback/Muscle | Monthly Cost |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Minimal | Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot) | Haiku | ~$5-10 |
| Moderate | Sonnet 4.6 | Haiku | ~$20-40 |
| Power | Opus 4.6 | Sonnet 4.6 | ~$100-200 |

Get your API key from your chosen provider. Paste it into a notepad first — make sure it's one line, no breaks — then give it to the agent.

### Messaging Setup

**Telegram (recommended):** Create a bot via @BotFather, get the token, configure it in your agent. Lock it to your user ID only — this is a security requirement, not optional.

**Discord:** Create a private server with only you as a member. Create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal. Add it to your server. Good for multi-channel workflows later (alerts, research, drafts, approvals).

### Verify
Send a message to your agent. If it responds, Phase 1 is done.

---

## Phase 2: Identity & Rules

This is where most people skip ahead and regret it. These files are the difference between "generic assistant" and "useful teammate." Do not skip this phase.

### TODO
- [ ] Create SOUL.md — who your agent is
- [ ] Create USER.md — who you are
- [ ] Create OPERATING_CONTRACT.md — behavioral rules and guardrails
- [ ] Introduce yourself to the agent (brain dump about your goals)

### SOUL.md (Agent Identity)

This is the most important file. It tells the agent who it is, how to behave, and what matters. Put this in your agent's workspace directory.

Tell your agent:
> "Create a SOUL.md for yourself. You are my personal AI agent. Your name is [pick one or let it choose]. Your core traits: proactive, direct, no fluff. You should advance my goals without waiting for permission on routine tasks. Always explain your reasoning when making significant decisions. Never perform destructive actions without confirming first."

Customize the traits to match how you want to interact. Some people want formal, some want casual. Some want maximum autonomy, some want approval gates.

Without a SOUL.md, every session starts from zero. With one, the agent starts making decisions you agree with before you ask. You'll know it's working when you stop having to repeat yourself.

### USER.md (About You)

Brain dump everything relevant:
> "Here's who I am: [your name, role, background]. My current goals: [list them — this is the most important part]. My timezone: [X]. My communication preferences: [terse/detailed, formal/casual]. Tools I already use: [list them]. Topics I care about: [list them]."

This gets saved to memory and shapes every future interaction. The more specific you are about your goals, the more useful the agent becomes.

### OPERATING_CONTRACT.md (Guardrails)

Non-negotiable behavioral rules. These prevent the agent from doing things you'll regret. Start with:
> "Create an OPERATING_CONTRACT.md with these rules:
> 1. Never spend money or make purchases without explicit approval
> 2. Never post publicly (social media, forums, emails to others) without my review
> 3. Never delete files without listing them first and getting my explicit confirmation
> 4. Never share my personal information externally
> 5. Always explain your reasoning for significant decisions
> 6. If uncertain, ask — don't guess
> 7. If you find yourself repeating the same action more than twice, stop and tell me — you might be looping
> 8. When a task is ambiguous, present options instead of picking one silently"

Add or remove rules as you build trust. These are living documents — update them whenever the agent does something you didn't want.

## Phase 3: The Brains & Muscles Pattern

This is the single most impactful thing for cost and quality. Don't skip it.

**Brain** = The orchestrator. Decides *what* to do. Needs to be smart.
- Opus 4.6, GPT-4o, Sonnet 4.6
- Handles planning, decision-making, conversation

**Muscles** = Workers. Do the *actual work*. Can be cheaper or specialized.
- Coding: Codex, DeepSeek, local models
- Web search: Brave API
- Summarization: Haiku, Gemini Flash
- Image generation: DALL-E, Flux

### TODO
- [ ] Configure model routing (cheap models for simple tasks, smart models for thinking)
- [ ] Set a daily spending limit
- [ ] Verify routing is working (ask: "What model are you using right now?")

Tell your agent:
> "Set up model routing. For coding tasks, use [Codex/DeepSeek]. For web searches, use Brave API. For quick summaries, formatting, and simple lookups, use Haiku. Keep [your primary model] for planning, complex reasoning, and conversation. Always delegate to the cheapest model that can handle the task. Track my daily API spending — if I go over $[AMOUNT] in a day, alert me and pause non-essential tasks."

This single pattern cuts costs by 50-80% while maintaining quality where it matters. Without it, your expensive brain model handles everything including tasks a $0.001 model could do.

---

## Phase 4: Security Basics

### TODO
- [ ] Verify messaging is locked to your user ID (should be done in Phase 1)
- [ ] Bind gateway to localhost only
- [ ] Set file permissions on agent config directory
- [ ] Set up external secrets (don't hardcode API keys in config files)
- [ ] Set a restrictive tool policy

### The Three Rules

1. **Lock your messaging channel.** Only YOUR user ID can talk to the agent. If someone else can message your bot, they control your computer. No exceptions.
2. **Bind the gateway to localhost.** Never expose port 18789 (or whatever your gateway port is) to the internet. Use Tailscale or SSH tunnels for remote access.
3. **Don't hardcode secrets.** Use your platform's secrets manager (`openclaw secrets set KEY`) or environment variables. API keys in config files = one git push away from compromise.

### File Permissions

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.openclaw          # or your agent's config directory
chmod 600 ~/.openclaw/*.json   # config files readable only by you
```

### Tool Policy

Start restrictive, loosen as you build trust:
> "Set your tool policy to ask for confirmation before: running shell commands, accessing the browser, making network requests to new domains, or modifying system files. You can freely: read files in your workspace, write to your workspace, and search the web via Brave API."

---

## Phase 5: Your First Automation (One Thing, End-to-End)

Don't try to automate everything at once. Pick ONE workflow, get it working perfectly, then add the next.

### TODO
- [ ] Set up a daily morning brief (recommended first automation for everyone)
- [ ] Set up a heartbeat (periodic check-in)
- [ ] Verify the cron fires and you receive the message

### Morning Brief

Send this to your agent:
> "Schedule a morning brief for me every day at [TIME] [TIMEZONE]. Send it to my [Telegram/Discord]. Include:
> 1. Weather for [YOUR CITY]
> 2. Top 3 news items in [YOUR INTERESTS]
> 3. My pending tasks for today
> 4. One thing you can do for me today that advances my goals
> Keep it under 200 words. No fluff."

**Important:** After setting this up, verify it actually fires. Run `openclaw cron list` and check that "Next" shows a future time. If the morning brief doesn't arrive tomorrow, check logs (`openclaw logs --follow`) and troubleshoot before adding more automations.

### Heartbeat

The heartbeat is a periodic check-in where your agent evaluates what needs doing:
> "Set your heartbeat to every 30 minutes. On each heartbeat, check: are there pending tasks? Should anything proactive happen? Is anything time-sensitive coming up? Only message me if there's something actually worth reporting — don't send empty check-ins."

### Goal-Specific Second Workflow (pick one)

**Content creators:**
> "Every day at [TIME], scan [Twitter/Reddit/your sources] for trending topics in [YOUR NICHE]. Send me a summary of the top 3 with a one-line take on each. If something is blowing up, alert me immediately."

**Developers:**
> "Monitor my GitHub repos for new issues and PRs. Every morning, send me a summary of what's new. For critical issues (security, outages), alert me immediately."

**Researchers:**
> "Every Monday at 9am, search for new papers and articles about [YOUR TOPICS]. Summarize the top 5 with key takeaways. Save full summaries to my research folder."

**Business/Productivity:**
> "Every evening at 6pm, send me a daily wrap-up: what was accomplished today, what's still pending, and what's scheduled for tomorrow. Flag anything that's overdue."

---

## Phase 6: Skills & Tools

### TODO
- [ ] Build or install one skill relevant to your workflow
- [ ] Connect one external tool (web search at minimum)

### Skills

Skills are reusable capabilities — a SKILL.md file in a folder that tells your agent how to handle a specific type of task. Instead of explaining the same workflow every time, you package it once.

When you find yourself repeating a workflow:
> "Pause. Build a skill for this. Call it [SKILL NAME]. It should [describe what it does]. Save it so you can reuse it anytime I ask."

**Skill ideas to get you started:**
- Research skill — "When I say 'research [topic]', search the web, read the top 5 results, and give me a structured summary with sources"
- Tweet drafter — "When I say 'draft tweets about [topic]', generate 5 variations in my voice"
- Meeting prep — "When I have a meeting in 30 minutes, pull up notes on the person/topic and send me a brief"
- Weekly review — "Every Friday, summarize what I accomplished, what's still open, and suggest priorities for next week"

### Recommended First Tools

**Web search** (almost everyone needs this):
> "Set up Brave Search API for web searches. Here's my API key: [KEY]. Use it when I ask you to research something or when you need current information."

**Web scraping** (for content/research workflows):
> "Set up Firecrawl for web scraping. Here's my API key: [KEY]. Use it to extract content from URLs I share or when research requires reading full articles."

**Calendar** (for productivity workflows):
> "Connect to my Google Calendar. I want you to check my schedule before suggesting tasks and alert me 15 minutes before meetings."

---

## Phase 7: Memory & Persistence

This is what separates a toy from a tool. Without this, your agent gets progressively dumber as stale context accumulates.

### TODO
- [ ] Understand how memory works (it's just files, not magic)
- [ ] Set up nightly memory maintenance
- [ ] Fill in workspace docs (USER.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md)

### How Memory Works

Your agent's memory is files on disk — MEMORY.md, daily logs, session history. This means:
- **Anything not written down is forgotten between sessions.** If you close the chat, the context is gone.
- Memory files grow over time and need pruning, or they fill the context window with stale info.
- For background/overnight work, you need cron jobs with isolated sessions — not just "work on this and I'll check tomorrow."

### Tiered Memory

Not everything is equally important. Think in three tiers:

**Constitutional** — never expires. Security rules, your identity, hard constraints.

**Strategic** — refreshed quarterly. Current projects, creative direction, active goals.

**Operational** — auto-archives after 30 days unused. Current bugs, temporary workarounds, session-specific context. This is the clutter that makes your agent dumb if you don't clean it up.

### Nightly Memory Maintenance

This is the single most important automation for long-term agent quality:
> "Schedule a nightly task at 11pm. Review today's sessions: ensure all important decisions are documented in persistent files, clean up outdated operational memory, and verify that a fresh agent session could reconstruct the current state from workspace files alone. If something important would be lost when this session ends, write it down now."

### Fill In Your Workspace Docs

Don't leave workspace files empty. The more context your agent has in persistent files, the less it needs to re-learn each session:
> "Review all workspace files (USER.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md). Fill in anything that's empty or outdated based on what we've set up today. These files are your persistent context — treat them like your long-term memory."

---

## Phase 8: First Week — Iterate & Refine

### TODO
- [ ] Use the agent for one full week
- [ ] Review and update SOUL.md based on what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Review and update OPERATING_CONTRACT.md (add rules for any unwanted behaviors)
- [ ] Build skills for any workflow you've repeated 3+ times
- [ ] Run the Life Automation Audit (optional but transformative)

### The Refinement Loop

After a week of use:
> "Let's review your performance this week. What worked well? What caused friction? What did I have to repeat or correct multiple times? What rules should we add to OPERATING_CONTRACT.md? Update SOUL.md and OPERATING_CONTRACT.md based on what we learned."

### The Life Automation Audit (Optional but Transformative)

Once your agent is stable, this is the highest-leverage exercise you can do. It systematically catalogs every recurring task in your life and identifies what to automate.

> "Let's do a life automation audit. Walk me through each area of my life — morning routine, work, communication, finances, health, learning, social media, home, evening — and for each one, ask me what I do repeatedly. Then categorize each task: automate fully, automate with approval, assist only, or keep manual. Build a prioritized implementation plan starting with the highest-impact, lowest-effort automations."

This typically surfaces 10-20 automations people didn't realize they could delegate.

## Quick Reference: Key Commands

```bash
# Status & health
openclaw status                    # full system status
openclaw gateway status            # is the gateway running?
openclaw doctor --fix              # auto-fix common issues

# Cron jobs
openclaw cron list                 # see all scheduled jobs + next fire time
openclaw cron create --name "job" --cron "0 9 * * *" --message "do the thing"

# Sessions
openclaw sessions list             # active sessions
openclaw sessions cleanup --older-than 7d   # prune old sessions

# Security
openclaw security audit            # check for issues
openclaw secrets set MY_API_KEY    # store secrets safely

# Models
/model                             # switch models mid-session

# Logs
openclaw logs --follow             # live log stream
```

---

## What NOT To Do

1. **Don't give it admin/root access.** Run the agent as a non-privileged user.
2. **Don't let it post publicly without review.** Always gate social media, emails, and public content behind your approval.
3. **Don't ignore costs.** Set spending limits day one. A runaway loop can burn through $50 in an hour.
4. **Don't skip identity files.** Without SOUL.md and OPERATING_CONTRACT.md, you get a generic assistant that loops and forgets. With them, you get a teammate.
5. **Don't hardcode API keys.** Use secrets management. Leaked keys = compromised accounts.
6. **Don't try to set up everything at once.** Get Phases 1-5 working first. One automation working reliably beats ten that are broken.
7. **Don't expect "work on this overnight" to just work.** Background work needs cron jobs with isolated sessions, not an open chat window.
8. **Don't forget to verify.** After setting up any cron job, check that it actually fires. `openclaw cron list` → look at the "Next" column. If it says a time in the past, something is broken.

---

## Going Deeper

Once you're comfortable with the basics (give it at least a week), explore:

- **Multi-agent setups** — Spawn specialized sub-agents for parallel work. Your main agent becomes a planner that delegates to specialists (research agent, coding agent, content agent).
- **Mission Control** — Build a custom dashboard with approval queues, task tracking, content pipelines. Tell your agent: "Build me a mission control using Next.js. Start with an approvals page where I can review content before it posts."
- **Local models** — Run models on your own hardware via Ollama for free unlimited tokens. Great for coding muscles and summarization. Requires Mac Mini or better.
- **Content pipelines** — Automated research → draft → review → publish. The agent does 80%; you do the final review.
- **Discord as structured output** — Use Telegram for conversation, Discord for organized streams: #alerts, #research, #drafts, #approvals, #daily-log.
- **Dedicated hardware** — An old laptop, Raspberry Pi ($50), or Mac Mini ($600) running 24/7. Your daily computer can sleep; the agent never does.

Don't rush into these. A well-configured single agent with good identity files and a few reliable automations will transform your workflow more than a complex multi-agent setup you don't maintain.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Agent doesn't respond to messages:**
Check if the gateway is running (`openclaw gateway status`). Check if your messaging channel shows "OK" in `openclaw status`. Verify your bot token is correct. Try `openclaw doctor --fix`.

**Cron jobs aren't firing:**
Run `openclaw cron list` — check that jobs show future "Next" times, not dates in the past. If they're stuck, restart the gateway. Check logs with `openclaw logs --follow`.

**Agent keeps looping (repeating the same action):**
Add anti-looping rules to OPERATING_CONTRACT.md: "If you find yourself taking the same action more than twice in a row, stop and report what's happening." Also check if your model handles tool calls reliably — some models produce malformed tool calls that cause retry loops.

**Costs are higher than expected:**
Your brain model is doing muscle work. Set up model routing (Phase 3). Check with: "Show me a breakdown of my API costs this week by model and task type."

**Agent forgets things between sessions:**
Memory isn't being persisted to disk. Check that MEMORY.md exists and is being updated. Set up nightly memory maintenance (Phase 7). The most common cause: long sessions accumulate context but never write it to files.

**Agent does something you didn't want:**
Update OPERATING_CONTRACT.md immediately with a specific new rule. Not "be more careful" but "never delete files without listing them first and getting my explicit approval." Specific rules work. Vague instructions don't.
